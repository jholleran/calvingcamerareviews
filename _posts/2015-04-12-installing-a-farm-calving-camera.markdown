If you are a farmer that breeds cows you will know all about the extra work involved in looking after them during the calving season. Having to go back to the cattle shed, many times, during the day just to see if one of them is about to give birth is very time-consuming. Worst of all, getting up during cold dark nights and going back for look at the animals can deprive you of a lot of sleep. Most of the time, there might be nothing happening. You might be lucky if your cattle shed is close to your home but if the shed is far away it makes things very difficult for you.
