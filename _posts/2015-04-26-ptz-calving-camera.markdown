#PTZ Camera

PTZ (Pan, Tilt & Zoom) are very useful when you want to view large shed areas with a single Camera. You can control the viewing angle of the Camera. If set up to have a two way communication between the Camera and PC the viewing angle can be changed remotly from the PC.

Here is a small animation of me panning the Camera around the Cattle Shed. In reality the picture quality is better and is less jumpy. The resolution was reduced to save bandwidth, but you should get the idea.
