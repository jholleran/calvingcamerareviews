#Analog CCTV Camera System
##Advantages
- Easy to setup and install
- Cheap to buy
- Analog CCTV is simple

##Disadvantages
- Scalability - can hit a limit on the number of cameras
- Resolution - Old technology that limites video quality

Analog video has been around for years and is a universal standard. This is by far the simpliest type of CCTV system that you can install as most of the equipement just plugs into one another, requiring very little configuration. From a learning curve and installation point of view, Analog CCTV is simple. All you need is a Analog CCTV Camera and a DVR box, run a cable betwen the two, plug them in and you have a Analog CCTV system up and running. 
Analog CCTV systems are very cheap. You can buy a complete video surveillance bundles that includes multiple cameras (4 to 8), cables and DVR (with harddrive) for a couple of hundred euros. 
There are significiant limitations when it comes to scalability and flexiblity. These systems are hard-wired and difficult to add more cameras. Each new camera need a seperate cable to the DVR. For example, if a DVR box has eight video input ports, you can connect up eight cameras. When you need to add a ninth camera your only option is to replace the DVR box with one with a higher number of input video ports or add a second independent DVR box.
Another downside to Analog CCTV is the cameras image quality is not as good as its being transmitted down a resolution limited pipe.
