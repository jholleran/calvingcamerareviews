        <title>Ip Wireless Directional Antenns</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;directional-antennas&quot;&gt;Directional Antennas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Directional Antennas contain both a transmitter and a receiver. This means there is a two way communication between the two IP Directional Antennas. Two way communication is important if you wish to use a &lt;a href=&quot;/ptz/2015/04/26/ptz-calving-camera.html&quot;&gt;PTZ IP Camera&lt;/a&gt; and control the viewing angle for the camera remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directional Antennas transmit radio waves in a single direction. The signal will only be picked up the direction that it’s pointing. As it focuses the radio waves in one direction it can transmit and receive longer distances than Omi-directional Antennas. In most farms, this is exactly what is needed for setting up a Calving Camera as the Shed can be a long distance from the House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;set-up&quot;&gt;Set Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Directional Antennas are very simple to connect together. On one side, the IP Camera plugs directly into one of the Directional IP Antenna with an Ethernet cable. One the other, the second Directional Antenna plugs directly in a Router, PC, or Laptop with another Ethernet Cable. When the antennas are set up to communicate with one another you will be able to connect to the camera from your PC or Laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a connection diagram of how the Direction Antennas are integrated into the Calving Camera System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ubiquiti-nanostation&quot;&gt;Ubiquiti NanoStation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EGI3CI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004EGI3CI&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jhollerano-20&amp;amp;linkId=APRWR6VNXX5WNQRM&quot;&gt;Ubiquiti NanoStation loco M2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jhollerano-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B004EGI3CI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt; is a very good, plug and play, product that is very simple to integrate with most IP Cameras, and other network devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loco M2 transmits at 150 Mbps, which is very fast and is more than enough to transmit live video from the Camera very smoothly. It also has a very long range of 5+ km, which is sufficient for most farms, but if you need a longer range you can get the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EHSV4W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004EHSV4W&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jhollerano-20&amp;amp;linkId=D2ICM7EKQFEM2PIO&quot;&gt;Ubiquiti NanoStation loco M5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jhollerano-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=B004EHSV4W&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt; which will transmit up to 10+ km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Antennas can be used outdoors and can be mounted to a pole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;poe&quot;&gt;POE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Directional Antennas are power by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_over_Ethernet&quot;&gt;POE&lt;/a&gt;. POE stands for Power over Ethernet. This basically means that the Antenna is powered by the Ethernet Cable and means that there is no need for a separate power cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wireless-security&quot;&gt;Wireless Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always make sure that the Wireless Security settings (WEP or WPA &amp;amp; WPA2) are set up correctly on these Antennas, and are password protected. This will encrypt the data being sent, to and from the antennas, and prevent other, unwanted guests, from hacking into your network. The radio signal from these Directional Antenna can picked up from a very long distance away so it would be better to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wireless Connection To Calving Camera</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If the distance between your House and Shed is too far to run cables you can transmit the video through wireless. There are many types of Antennas that can be used depending on the distance between the two building and the type of Camera System you wish to install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Omnidirectional radiates radio waves uniformly in all directions. This radiation pattern looks like a doughnut shape. If you are planning to install a number of Calving Cameras in different Sheds on the farm an omnidirectional antennas is an ideal choice. As long as the radiation pattern covers all the Sheds then multiple Cameras, in different Sheds, can be installed and connect wirelessly to the omnidirectional antenna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although high powered omnidirectional antennas can go long distances they are not as efficient as directional antennas. Directional Antennas focus the radio waves in single and narrow direction which means that longer distances can be achieved with a lot less power. These antennas are better for long distances and when the wireless connection is only needed between two points.
Directional antennas are and excellent choice for use in a Calving Camera System as usually the shed where you keep your cattle are a long distance from the house where you live. These distances can be a couple of hundred of meters to a couple of kilometres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directional antennas can be used in a CCTV or an IP Camera Systems. There is a difference between the setup for a CCTV and for IP systems. For a CCTV system there is only a one way signal between antennas, one antenna will transmit the signal and the other will only receive the signal. In an IP system there is a two way communication between antennas, both antennas will transmit and receive the signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/long-range-cctv.png&quot; alt=&quot;long range cctv system&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two antennas are fitted outside the two building (Shed and House) facing each other. The higher up they are the better as to avoid obstructing buildings. Having a clear line of sight between the antennas well help to avoid any interference to the signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Camera is connected into the Directional Antenna in the Shed and transmits the video, as radio waves, to the other Directional Antenna, which will receive the video, and is connected into the TV to be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a later post I will go into detail about the type of Antennas that can be used and how to set them up. If you want to get notifications of these posts you can follow us on Twitter or friend us up on Facebook using the links bellow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Infrared Calving Cameras</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Cameras can come with Infrared built in, giving the camera Night Vision. Infrared Cameras (IR) gives the ability to view the video, from the camera, in low light or complete darkness. During the day when there is plenty of light the camera works as normal but when the light goes below a certain level the Infrared kick in. 
Having Infrared in a Calving Camera is very useful so that you can view your animals in your shed without having the lights turned on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both CCTV and IP Cameras can have Infrared built in. An infrared camera has IR LEDs on the outer edge of the camera which gives the camera Night Vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ir-camera-leds.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;infrared night vision camera leds&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample of what Night Vision Infrared Camera picture looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/infrared-night-camera.png&quot; alt=&quot;infrared night vision camera&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture quality will not be as good as viewing during day light. The picture will be in black and white and not everything will be viewable, such as objects in a distance, but it can be enough to give you an idea of what is going on. Always check the distance that the IR LEDs can view on the camera. The product details should contain this information. Some cameras can view only 25 meters night vision other can view 100 meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without Infrared Night Vision you would need to keep the lights on in your shed at night which will increase your electricity bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ptz Calving Camera</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;ptz-calving-camera&quot;&gt;PTZ Calving Camera&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PTZ (Pan, Tilt &amp;amp; Zoom) are very useful when you want to view large shed areas with a single Camera. You can control the viewing angle of the Camera. If set up to have a two way communication between the Camera and PC the viewing angle can be changed remotly from the PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a small animation of me panning the Camera around the Cattle Shed. In reality the picture quality is better and is less jumpy. The resolution was reduced to save on bandwidth, but you should get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/pan-camera-around.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Panning camera viewing angle around shed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common, and popular, type of Camera with PTZ functionality is an &lt;a href=&quot;/ip/2015/04/24/ip-calving-camera-system.html&quot;&gt;IP Camera&lt;/a&gt;. All IP Cameras have two way communication between the Camera and the Host. What I mean by two way communication is that the IP Camera sends data (video stream) to the Host PC and the PC can also send data to the IP Camera (configuration settings or viweing angle changes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advantages&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can view large areas with a single Camera&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less Cameras required&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can change the Camera viewing angle easily&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zoom in on a targe to get a better picture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disadvantages&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Need to have a two way communication between Camera and Computer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More expensive than static Camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Ip Calving Camera System</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;ip-calving-camera-system&quot;&gt;IP Calving Camera System&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;equipement&quot;&gt;Equipement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IP Camera&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wifi Router&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RJ45 Cat6 Ethernet Cable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ip-camera-wired-connection-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;IP Camera connection diagram with RJ45 cable&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the IP Camera nowadays have a Wifi antenna included. With this there is no need for the Ethernet Cable. The IP Camera will connect to the Wifi Router through Wifi. You may already have a Wifi Router in your home that you use to connect up to the internet. If so, there may not be a need to purchase another one. The Wifi Router acts as a bridge between the IP Camera and you PC. If your PC has WIFI then it can wirelessly connect to the Router, or just use an Ethernet Cable to connect the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ip-camera-wireless-connection-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;Wirless IP Camera connection diagram with no cables&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IP camera will need to be in range of the Router. If the Router is a standard one then this range will not be very far, usually around 20-30 meters. Also, if the distance between the Shed, where the IP Camera will be fitted, and the house, where you want to view the video, is far away and is not possible to run a Ethernet Cable (greater 100 meters) you should consider &lt;a href=&quot;#TODO insert link&quot;&gt;transmit the video with wireless wifi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-ethernet-cables&quot;&gt;Using Ethernet Cables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect the IP Cameras directly into one of the Ethernet connections of the Wifi Router. The Router can be connected directly, in most cases, using wireless to your laptop or PC. If the IP Camera has a Wifi antenna then there is no need for any cables. The IP Camera and Router will automatically connect together through wireless. A Wireless IP Camera makes the setup of this system trivial.
If you are using Ethernet Cables you can skip the next &lt;a href=&quot;#using-wifi&quot;&gt;Using Wifi&lt;/a&gt; step and go straight to the &lt;a href=&quot;#router-settings&quot;&gt;Router Settings&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-wifi&quot;&gt;Using Wifi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the IP Camera can connect to the Router wirelessly you may need to configure the IP Camera to allow it to connect. This is needed if the Router needs a Security WPA key to connect. This step may vary from different IP Camara manufactors, so check the instructions given first. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its a good idea to do this before the IP Camera is installed and fitted to the shed as you will have better access to connections on the IP Camera and it will make setting things up easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually you first need to install a small progam on your PC and plug the camera directly into the PC using the Ethernet cable provided. Start the program and it will connect to the IP Camera. From there, find the Network Settings, or Wireless Settings. There should be a button to scan for other Network devices. If the Router is in range then it should show up on the results list. Enter your WPA key, if needed, and connect. The IP Camera should now connect to the Router using Wifi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;router-settings&quot;&gt;Router Settings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log into your Router admin page. There will be a page that will show you all the devices that are connected. If the IP camera and the Router are communicating correctly then you should see the IP Camera listed. It should contain an IP address (for example: 192.168.1.2). This IP address is given to the camera by the router when they have connected. The IP address could be different every time the camera or router is restarted. If you want you can set the IP address on the camera to be static so that it will always be the same. This is sometimes a better option as you use this IP address to log into the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy this IP address into your browser top URL field and press enter. This should connect to the IP Camera landing page. From there you should be able to see the Video stream from the Camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/live-cows-from-camera.gif&quot; alt=&quot;wireless ip camera with router and computer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t see the IP Camera listed in the Router LAN list then check that the Subnet Mask is the same on both the Camera and the Router. Its usually set to 255.255.255.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advantages&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resolution - Good Quality Picture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flexibility - PTZ cameras can be controlled from PC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security - Passwords can be added to stop unwanted guests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scalability - Many IP camera can be added at any time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disadvantages&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can be complex to set up if your not used to ethernet devices &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IP Cameras are more expensive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-information&quot;&gt;More Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Internet Protocal Camera, or IP Camera, are nowadays very popular for surveillance. IP Cameras differ from Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Cameras in that they send and receive data. The IP Camera and the PC can communicate with each other back and forth. This allow the Camera to be controlled remotely, for configuring the Camera and changing settings to controlling the viewing angle of the Camera, if it able to Pan, Tilt, and Zoom (PTZ). Allowing the user to change what the Camera is looking at makes Camera alot more useful when surveilling large areas with a single camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different types of IP Cameras that you can buy and some can be very expensive. They can be expense as they have high quality picture, they can zoom into very small area. My advice here is to look into where and how you are going to use the camera. If you have a medium sized shed or you only want to surveil a small section (a small calving pen) then a cheap IP camera will be sufficiant and will work well. If you later want to view a larger area then you can upgrade the camera only to a more expensive and high quality one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about having an IP Camera is that it is compatable with a lot of different devices. For example; Smarth Phones. There are lots of Apps that can be download so that you can connect your phone to the IP Camera. This is very useful for you to check your cows anytime you want to. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cctv Calving Camera System</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;analog-cctv-camera-system&quot;&gt;Analog CCTV Camera System&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;equipement&quot;&gt;Equipement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analog Camera&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Video Splitter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coaxial Cable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Video Splitter in used to connect up multiple Cameras so they can all be viewed simultaneously on the same channel. The cameras video will be split up on the same screen. The Video Splitter can also be used to switch between each camera, one at a time. It can also be set to automatically switch between each camera at a set interval. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the distance between the Shed, where the camera will be fitted, and the house, where you want to view the video, is far away and is not possible to run a coaxial cable. In this case, you can &lt;a href=&quot;#TODO insert link&quot;&gt;transmit the video signal by wireless&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of a Video Splitter a &lt;a href=&quot;#insert dvr link&quot;&gt;DVR (Digital Video Recorder)&lt;/a&gt; can be used to connect up the cameras. DVR are useful if you want to record the video from the camera and back play over the previous days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect the Cameras to the Video Slitter with a Coaxial Cable. Plug the Camera and Video Splitter power cables in. Connect the Video Splitter to your TV with another Coaxial Cable. Tune your TV to find the Video channel. When you find the channel the Video from the camera should be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/cctv-camera-system.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cctv camera system with four cameras&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advantages&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy to setup and install&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cheap to buy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Analog CCTV is simple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very little configuration to get up and running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disadvantages&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scalability - Can hit a limit on the number of cameras&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resolution - Old technology that limits video picture quality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flexibility - Can’t control the camera remotely (Pan/Tilt/Zoom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-information&quot;&gt;More information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analog video has been around for years and is a universal standard. This is by far the simplest type of CCTV system that you can install as most of the equipment just plugs into one another, requiring very little configuration. From a learning curve and installation point of view, Analog CCTV is simple. All you need is an Analog CCTV Camera and a DVR box, run a cable between the two, plug them in and you have an Analog CCTV system up and running. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analog CCTV systems are very cheap. You can buy a complete video surveillance bundles that include multiple cameras (4 to 8), cables and DVR (with hard drive) for a couple of hundred euros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are significant limitations when it comes to scalability and flexibility. These systems are hard-wired and difficult to add more cameras. Each new camera needs a separate cable to the DVR. For example, if a DVR box has eight video input ports, you can connect up eight cameras. When you need to add a ninth camera your only option is to replace the DVR box with one with a higher number of input video ports or add a second independent DVR box. 
Another downside to Analog CCTV is the cameras image quality is not as good as its being transmitted down a resolution limited pipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you buy any equipment make sure they are compatible with each other. The best way is to check the specification and the connector types so they can be plugged into together. Most of the Analog Cameras and Video Splitter use BNC input connectors. It’s a good idea to check that out before you buy.&lt;/p&gt;
