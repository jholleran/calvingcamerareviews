#Long Range Wireless CCTV Setup
In a CCTV wireless setup there will be one transmitting Antenna and one receiving Antenna. The Camera will be connected to a Transmitter and the Transmitter is connected on one of the Directional Antenna. On the other side the Directional Antenna is connected to a Receiver and the Receiver can be connected to a TV or a DVR.
Some Antennas can come with the Transmitter and Receivers built in which makes the system very simple.

#Long Range Wireless IP Setup
IP Directional Antennas contain a transmitter and a receiver. This means there is two way communication between two IP Antennas. Two way communication is important if you wish to use a PTZ IP Camera and control the viewing angle for the camera remotely. 
IP Antenna are very simple to connect together. On one side, the IP Camera plugs directly into one of the Directional IP Antenna with a Ethernet cable. One the other, the second Directional Antenna plugs directly in a Router with another Ethernet Cable. From there, your PC or laptop can connect to the Router with an Ethernet cable or wirelessly.
