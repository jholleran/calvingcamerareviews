##Foscam IP Camera


##PT functionality
This camera has a 355-degree pan and 90-degree tilt giving the user comprehensive coverage over the monitored site. There is no zoom on this camera. This camera is best suited for a medium to small shed where there is not a large distance to monitor.

##Nightvision
The Nightvision range of the camera is 15 meters and with 22 IR LEDs the images from the camera in darkness works extremely well and clear. The nightvision is not focused in a single area so the full image from the camera can be seen. Also, as with all nightvision camera the images will be in black and white. 

##DDNS
One of the very nice features of this camera is that it comes with a free embedded unique DDNS domain name. This can be used for accessing the camera remotely from another network. For example, if the domain name assigned to the camera is you can access your camera remotely by typing http://1234.myfoscam.org into a browser.
