##Foscam IP Camera
I've used a Foscam F18918W IP PT camera in the past as a calving camera and I find them fantastic for use in a medium to small sixed shed. They are a nice tidy camera and are easy to setup and use. The picture quaility is 300K pixels which is clear enough to get a good view of whats going on. The camera works best when kept as close as possible to the pen(s) that you want to monitor.


##PT functionality
This camera has a 355-degree pan and 90-degree tilt giving the user comprehensive coverage over the monitored site. There is no zoom on this camera. This camera is best suited for a medium to small shed where there is not a large distance to monitor.

##Nightvision
The Nightvision range of the camera is 15 meters and with 22 IR LEDs the images from the camera in darkness works extremely well and clear. The nightvision is not focused in a single area so the full image from the camera can be seen. Also, as with all nightvision camera the images will be in black and white. 

##DDNS
One of the very nice features of this camera is that it comes with a free embedded unique DDNS domain name. This mean the camera can be accessed remotely, from another network, on a mobile phone or PC. The free DDNS domain name is hosted by Foscam. For example; the domain name assigned is could be in the following format: http://1234.myfoscam.org. Typing this into your browser will access your camera. If you want more information about how a DDNS works you have a look at the following [article.]({{site.baseurl}}/internet/2015/08/08/viewing-calving-camera-over-the-internet.html)

##Apps
Foscam have apps that were built for these cameras on the Andriod and Apple apps store. These apps are very easy to set up. Simply configure the app by entering the IP address, or domain name.

##Other Features
The camera also has some nice features such as:
- Picture quality
- Free DDNS
- Pre-set Points
- Strong hardened waterproof outer shell

##Negatives
The only small negative thing I have with this camera is that there is no zoom on it. Other than that its a great camera.
