Bullet Cameras are small video cameras that are shaped like a rifle bullets. These cameras are typically the width of a cigar. Bullet cameras easily mount on ceilings or walls. The main advantage of Bullet Cameras is their low cost and small size. Although they have a low cost and are very small, they still provide excellent picture quality and video recording. 

Infrared Bullet Cameras are larger in diameter than standard bullet cameras. The larger diameter is due to an array of infrared LEDs that are positioned around the lense of the camera which allow the camera to view objects in low light or darkness. 
[Infrared Cameras]({{site.baseurl}}/cameras/2015/05/03/infrared-calving-cameras.html) are nearly always a better choice for use as a calving camera. The reason for this is that you may want to view you cattle in the shed at night when its dark. Having night vision in the camera will save you money as there is no need to leave lights on in the shed.

Bullet cameras are an ideal choice when you only want to view a small certain area of your shed such as a calving pen or a single bay of the shed. As they are small and cheap cameras multiple bullet cameras can be used in the same shed which will give larger coverage.

Bullet cameras are also more reliable than [Dome PTZ Cameras]({{site.baseurl}}/ptz/2015/04/26/ptz-calving-camera.html) because there are no moving parts inside the camera. The lens of the camera is static and doesn't move. 

Most [CCTV calving camera systems]({{site.baseurl}}/cctv/2015/04/23/cctv-calving-camera-system.html) use bullet cameras as are very simple systems to setup. From the camera side the video signal only needs to be transmitted. It does not need to received any signal as the camera does not need to be controlled.

If you are thinking of using bullet cameras to use as a calving camera make sure that it has the following features:

- Waterproof
- High picture quaility
- Nightvision


###Waterproof
This is very important, even if the camera will be inside the shed. Most sheds are damp and mositure could penetrat the camera. So make sure its suitable for outdoors and is watherproof

###High picture quaility
This is important for every type of camera that the picture is clear so everything is visible (TODO insert a range that is good)

###Nightvision
if you want to be able to view at night or in low light nightvision is very useful. Make sure the nightvision range is sufficent to your needs. If your camera is overlooking the full shed you will need longer nightvision that if its looking at a close smaller area.
