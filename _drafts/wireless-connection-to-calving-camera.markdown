If the distance between your House and Shed is too far to run cables you can transmit the video through wireless. There are many types of antennas that can be used depending on the distance between the two building and the type of Camera System you wish to install

Omnidirectional radiates radio waves uniformly in all directions. This radiation pattern looks like a doughnut shape. If you are planning to install an number of Calving Cameras in different Sheds on the farm a Omidirectional antennas is a ideal choice. As long as the radiation pattern covers all the Sheds then multiple Cameras, in different Sheds, can be installed and connect wirelessly to the Omidirectional antenna.

Although high powered Omidirectional antennas can go long distances they are not as efficient as directional antennas. Directional Antennas focus the radio waves in single and narrow direction. These antennas are better for long distances and the wireless connection is only needed between two points.

Here is a diagram of Calving Camera System using Directional antennas.

The two antennas are fitted outside the two building (Shed and House) facing each other. The higher up they are the better as to avoid obstructing buildings.
