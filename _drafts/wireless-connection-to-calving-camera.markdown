If the distance between your House and Shed is too far to run cables you can transmit the video through wireless. There are many types of antennas that can be used depending on the distance between the two building and the type of Camera System you wish to install

Omnidirectional radiates radio waves uniformly in all directions. This radiation pattern looks like a doughnut shape. If you are planning to install an number of Calving Cameras in different Sheds on the farm a Omidirectional antennas is a ideal choice. As long as the radiation pattern covers all the Sheds then multiple Cameras, in different Sheds, can be installed and connect wirelessly to the Omidirectional antenna.

Although high powered Omidirectional antennas can go long distances they are not as efficient as directional antennas. Directional Antennas focus the radio waves in single and narrow direction which means that longer distances can be acheived with a lot less power. These antennas are better for long distances and the wireless connection is only needed between two points.
Directional antennas are and excellent choice for use in a Calving Camera System as usually the shed where you keep your cattle are a long distance from the house where you live. These distances can be a couple of hundred of meters to a couple of kilometers.

Directional antennas can be used in a CCTV or an IP Camera Systems. There is a difference between the setup for a CCTV and for IP systems. For a CCTV system only a one way signal is needed but with an IP system two way communication is needed.

Two antennas are fitted outside the two building (Shed and House) facing each other. The higher up they are the better as to avoid obstructing buildings. Having a clear line of sight between the antennas well help to avoid any interference to the signal.

#Long Range Wireless CCTV Setup
In a CCTV wireless setup there will be one transmitting Antenna and one receiving Antenna. The Camera will be connected to a Transmitter and the Transmitter is connected on one of the Directional Antenna. On the other side the Directional Antenna is connected to a Receiver and the Receiver can be connected to a TV or a DVR.
Some Antennas can come with the Transmitter and Receivers built in which makes the system very simple.

#Long Range Wireless IP Setup
IP Directional Antennas contain a transmitter and a receiver. This means there is two way communication between two IP Antennas. Two way communication is important if you wish to use a PTZ IP Camera and control the viewing angle for the camera remotely. 
IP Antenna are very simple to connect together. On one side, the IP Camera plugs directly into one of the Directional IP Antenna with a Ethernet cable. One the other, the second Directional Antenna plugs directly in a Router with another Ethernet Cable. From there, your PC or laptop can connect to the Router with an Ethernet cable or wirelessly.
