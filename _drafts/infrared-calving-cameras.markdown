Cameras can come with Infrared built in, giving the Camera Nightvision. It gives the ability to view the video, from the camera, in low light or complete darkness. Durning the day when there is plenty of light the camera works as normal but when the light goes below a certain level the Infrared kick in. 
Having Infrared in a Calving Camera is very useful so that you can view your animals in your shed with out having the lights turned on.

Here is a sample of what Nightvision Infrared Camera picture looks like.

The picture quailty will not be as good as viewing durning day light. The picture will be in black and white and not everything will be viewable, such as objects in a distance, but it can be enough to give you an idea of what is going on.

Without Infrared Nightvision you would need to keep the lights on in your shed at night which will increase your electricity bill.
