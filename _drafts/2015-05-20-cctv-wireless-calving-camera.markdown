#Long Range Wireless CCTV Setup
In a CCTV wireless setup there will be one transmitting Antenna and one receiving Antenna. The Camera will be connected to a Transmitter and the Transmitter is connected on one of the Directional Antenna. On the other side the Directional Antenna is connected to a Receiver and the Receiver can be connected to a TV or a DVR.
Some Antennas can come with the Transmitter and Receivers built in which makes the system very simple.
